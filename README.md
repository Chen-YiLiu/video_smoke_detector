# Video-Smoke-Detector

This program analyzes video frames to look for smoke.
It gives a confidence level score between 0% and 100%.
To speed up the analysis, the program only analyzes every 10th frame in the source video stream.
Thus for example, for a 30 fps video, the video is analyzed 3 times per second.
The program is written based on the tensorflow retraining tutorial for flower recognition.

### Usage:
The program takes in a list of video files and overlays the smoke analysis results as a meter reading at the bottom of the screen.
The original videos' audio tracks will be stripped from the output videos.
